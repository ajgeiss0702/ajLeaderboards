# You can also set this to be blank if you dont want a comma
comma: ","

# What character should we use for the decimal?
decimal: "."

# What should values be called?
# In the default value, the statistic_player_kills board will have a name of "kills" to be displayed on signs after the value
value-names:
- "statistic_player_kills%kills"

# How often should we refresh the stats of online players?
# this is in ticks, so 20 ticks = 1 second
#  Default: 1200 (60 seconds)
stat-refresh: 1200

# Should this server update player stats?
#  If disabled, stats will not be recorded to the database, and ajleaderboards will basically only read from it.
#  This can be useful if you have a lobby where you want to display leaderboards, but want to make sure anything in the lobby
#   doesnt override the stats from other servers

# Debug option to print stuff that could be usefull to the developer.
# You should probably keep this disabled unless you know what you are doing or are told to turn it on.

# Requires debug to be true
#  Default: false
update-de-bug: false

# Should we use particles as debug to show where heads and armorstands are being looked for?
#  Default: false
particles: false

# Should we block the server when loading placeholders?
# If this is true, it can cause some lag when the placeholders first get loaded, but that only happens once
#  (until the server restarts again)
# Usually this isnt an issue, but if you see lag from ajLeaderboards and you dont have head blocks, maybe disable this
blocking-fetch: true

# Should we print some more stuff about the internals of fetching?
# You really only need to use this if the dev asks for it.

# Should ajLeaderboards update the stat as soon as the player joins?
# You should only disable this if you have issues with the player's stat resetting when they join
#  Default: true
update-on-join: true

# Only automatically update these boards.
# If this is an empty list (the default), then all boards will be updated
# update-stats, if disabled, will override this.

# How often (in ticks) should we update leaderboard signs?
#  Default: 20 (1 per second)

# If a player's score is 0 (and it wasn't 0 before) then ajLeaderboards will skip updating the player at first
# This is to fix plugins that return 0 while theyre still loading stats
#  Default: true
require-zero-validation: true

# These are "extra" placeholders that can be parsed to be displayed alongside the leaderboard
# For example, you can have a KDR leaderboard, then next to each player on the leaderboard,
#  you can show their actual kills and deaths
extras:
- "statistic_player_kills"

# Should we use luckperms contexts?
# Disable this if you are having issues with high database usage
# See how to use it here: https://wiki.ajg0702.us/ajleaderboards/setup/luckperms-contexts
#  Default: true

# Should we check for the dontupdate permission?
# The dontupdate permission will cause players (who have it) to not be added/updated on the leaderboard

#  Default: true

# What day of the week should WEEKLY leaderboards reset on?
# Options are monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday
# The weekly reset happens at midnight (12:00 am / 00:00) (the start of the day) of the day you put here
# Caps don't matter
#  Default: sunday
reset-weekly-on: sunday

# How many threads should ajLeaderboards be allowed to use maxiumum for fetching from the db?
# Most of the time, the number of threads used will be far less than this.
# This is ignored on mysql (and maxConnections is used for this instead)
# Lower this if you get the message "unable to create native thread: possibly out of memory or process/resource limits reached"
# I would __not__ recommend setting this below 20.
# Requires a server restart to change
#  Default: 4
